### Have Implemented:
  - Visualization
  - Clicking to see the spherical PDF at a point


### Yet To Do:


### Notes
This is a research-focused prototype. While not optimized for production performance, it offers a flexible environment for experimenting with neural path guiding in Mitsuba 3 using Python.


### Contributions
Suggestions, feedback, and contributions are welcome.
